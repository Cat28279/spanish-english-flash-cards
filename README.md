# spanish-english-flash-cards
Learn 1000 Spanish words and phrases with this flash cards app! Once you see the Spanish word on the screen, you have 5 seconds to think about it's equivalent in English. After 5 seconds, the card flips and you get the correct answer. If you guessed the answer, click on the Checkmark. If you didn't know the word, click on the X. After you are done using the app (you might get tired somewhere at the 500th word...), go back to the project folder and you will see that two new CSV files were created. "Known words" are the words you knew while playing the game, and "Unknown words" are the ones you didn't know.
